# RodriguezMSayHelloEndpoint
#Open Postman, run debug in vs code, copy paste url from debug console in vs code: ie. https://localhost:7021. After you do that, add /endpoint/sayhello to the end, and then your name with a slash before it. Press send and the console should output a greeting with your name!

#Peer review - Jovann: Code looks clean and works when I put in a name and returns the correct output.
